# E-Pharmacy

E-Pharmacy is a business model that deals with the preparation and sale of prescription and non-prescription medicine as in traditional pharmacies. However, online pharmacies take orders online and send the medicine to their destination.

A system that stores data and enables functionality that organizes and maintains the customer, transactions, and medication use the process within pharmacies.

## Working Model:

This is a Web and mobile-based application for consumers to upload the scanned copy of their prescriptions and place requests for medicines. The registered pharmacy checkout the medicine and sends customers the invoice for those medicines. If the customer wants to buy then he can place his order. The pharmacy owner confirms his order and sends his ordered medicine via home delivery.

## Project Goals:

We want to build a system that saves customers money and time with great accessibility (24\*7). This system will really be helpful to the old age, the job holders who have no time to go to the pharmacy, and the villagers.

Our system also brings the great opportunity to increase the business to those pharmacists who want to do business with us. By using this system, they can get more customers and manage their daily orders, selling expenses, and cost by using a single software.
So, this concept will help customers to get necessary medicines at their doorstep at a mere finger click and also help the local pharmacy to increase their business and easy maintenances.
